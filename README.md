Welcome to the Room Acoustics Simulator! Begin by configuring your room dimensions and source/receiver parameters. Our suggestion algorithm will then analyze your settings and recommend environments from our extensive database that closely match your criteria. You have the option to select from the suggested environments or pick from a library of over 17 distinct acoustic environments from around the world, powered by Open AIR. Additionally, you can import your own audio file to serve as the source sound. Our advanced signal processing techniques, including stochastic ray tracing and the application of room impulse responses, will be used to generate a final output signal that you can play and experience as if you are in the specified locations.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

To execute any MATLAB program on a computer without MATLAB installed, you must first install the Matlab Compiler Runtime (MCR). 
This is essential as it includes the core Matlab functionality needed by your application, on the target machine where you intend 
to deploy your application. Ensure that you install the same version of MCR as the version of Matlab was used to generate this program.
This app was built using MATLAB version 2023a so the MCR version would be 9.14. If MATLAB is installed,
verify that MATLAB Runtime(R2023a) is installed. If not, you can run the MATLAB Runtime installer.
To find its location, enter
  
    >>mcrinstaller
      
at the MATLAB prompt.
NOTE: You will need administrator rights to run the MATLAB Runtime installer. 

Alternatively, download and install the Windows version of the MATLAB Runtime for R2023a 
from the following link on the MathWorks website:

    https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html
   
For more information about the MATLAB Runtime and the MATLAB Runtime installer, see 
"Distribute Applications" in the MATLAB Compiler documentation  
in the MathWorks Documentation Center.


If you have MATLAB and App designer simply clone the repo in your MATLAB files directory
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/shyamal10/RoomAcousticSim.git
   ```
And run the .mlapp file.


### Installation (if MATLAB is not installed)


1. Download MATLAB Runtime 9.14 at link [[MCR](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html)] OR download from releases 
2. Follow installation instructions
3. Run exe file found in releases
